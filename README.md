# isla-lang

This constructs an OCaml datatype, parser, and pretty printer for the SMT
instruction-semantics description output by [isla](https://github.com/rems-project/isla/). Everything is generated
from file `isla_lang.ott` using [ott](https://github.com/ott-lang/ott).

## Installation

The recommended way of installing isla-lang is via `opam`. You can pin this
repository (which makes it available in your current switch) using:
```sh
opam pin add -y isla-lang "git+https://github.com/rems-project/isla-lang.git"
```
Or you can pin your local clone by running the following command at the root
of the repository:
```sh
opam pin add -y isla-lang .
```
Note that the previous command will install the last committed changes only,
and thus not include (staged or unstaged) local changes. You need to use the
`-w` option if you want to pin the repo with all the local changes.

To only install the project's dependencies, run the following command
from your local clone of the repository:
```sh
opam install --deps-only ./isla-lang.opam
```

## Development notes

The file `isla-lang.opam` is autogenerated by dune. This is configured in the
`dune-project` file.

Usual make command like `make`, `make install`, `make uninstall` and `make
clean` work as usual and are trivial calls to dune sub-commands. We advise
not to do manual installs with `make install` and use `opam` (as explained
above) instead.

Note that this package comes with PDF versions of the languages of isla
traces. To avoid having `pdflatex` as a dependency, these files are stored
in the repository under the `doc` directory. They can be updated by using
`make update_pdfs`.

The package also comes with an example program called `isla-lang`. From the
repository, it can be invoked with `dune exec -- isla-lang <ARGS>`. You can
run `dune exec -- isla-lang -h` to see a list of available options.
