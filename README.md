# isla-lang

This constructs an OCaml datatype, parser, and pretty printer for the SMT
instruction-semantics description output by isla. It uses
[ott](https://github.com/ott-lang/ott) to generate those from `isla_lang.ott`.
You can get it on `opam`.

Direct install with `opam`: `opam install .`.

## Details

This project needs `dune` to build (can be installed via opam)

Additional dependencies are `menhir` for parsing and `pprint` for
pretty-printing, both of which can be obtained on opam. You can also install
all of them with `opam install --deps-only .`.

The file `isla-lang.opam` is autogenerated by dune. Use `make opam` to
regenerate it.

Usual make command like `make`, `make install`, `make uninstall` and `make
clean` work as usual and are trivial to dune sub-commands. We advise not to do
manual installs with `make install` and use `opam` with `opam install .`
instead.

You can build PDF version of the language of isla traces with `make pdf`.
