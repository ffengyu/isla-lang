# isla-lang

This constructs an OCaml datatype, parser, and pretty printer for the SMT
instruction-semantics description output by isla.
It uses [ott](https://github.com/ott-lang/ott) to generate those from `isla_lang.ott`.

This project needs `dune` to build (can be installed via opam)

At present this needs the version `0.31` of ott installed.
The best way of doing that is to check it out from Github
and do `opam install .` in the repository. It's not on opam yet.

Normal dependencies are `menhir` for parsing and `pprint` for pretty-printing,
both of which can be obtained normally on opam. You can also install them with
`opam install --deps-only .`.

The file `isla-lang.opam` is autogenerated by dune. Use `make opam` to regenerate it.

Usual make command like `make`, `make install`, `make uninstall` and `make clean`
work as usual and are trivial to dune sub-commands.

You can build PDF version of the language of isla traces with `make pdf`.
